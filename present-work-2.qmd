## Presentation Order

The presentation order is determined by the time you sent me your member info (`c("John", "Jeremy", "Praful")` is the first to let me know, followed by `c("Sajjad", "Tanjina", "Dewan")`, etc) and random sampling as follows.

```{r}
team_lst <- list(c("John", "Jeremy", "Praful"), 
                 c("Sajjad", "Tanjina", "Dewan"),
                 c("Ethan", "Navid", "Sylvester"), 
                 c("Violet", "Vanessa", "Michele"), 
                 c("Rakesh", "Daniel", "Jeremy"), 
                 c("Sai", "Rohith", "Shristi"))
set.seed(2025)
team_lst[sample(1:6, 6)]
```
