<aside class="notes"><p>Most optimization algorithms follow the same idea: starting from a point x(0) (which is usually specified by the user) and move to a new point x(1) that improves the objective function value. Repeatedly performing this to get a sequence of points x(0),x(1),x(2),x(3),… until the certain stopping criterion is reached. Most algorithms differ in terms of how to move from the current point x(k) to the next, better target point x(k+1). This may depend on the smoothness or structure of f, constrains on the domain, computational complexity, memory limitation, and many others.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>If <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{H}\)</span> is difficult to compute, we may use some matrix to substitute it. For example, if we simplify use the identity matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{I}\)</span>, then this reduces to a first-order method to be introduced later. However, if we can get a good approximation, we can still solve this linear system and get to a better point. Then the question is how to obtain such matrix in a computationally inexpensive way. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFSG) algorithm is such an approach by iteratively updating its (inverse) estimation. For details, please see the <a href="https://teazrq.github.io/SMLR/optimization-basics.html#quasi-newton-methods">SMLR book</a>. We have already used the BFGS method previously in the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/optim.html">optim()</a></code> example. - when x(k+1) is not too far away from x(k), the quadratic approximation is fairly accurate.</p>
