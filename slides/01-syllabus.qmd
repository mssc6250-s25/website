- Hello everyone, how are you? I hope you have a great winter break. Welcome to 6250 Statistical Machine Learning course. I am your instructor Cheng-Han Yu.  

- First thing first. Get to know each other. Let me first introduce my self. I was born and grew up in Taipei, Taiwan, my home country, which is a island right next to China. Taipei is a big city in terms of population. It is about the same population size as Chicago. This building is called Taipei 101, which is the tallest building in Taiwan.

::: notes
After college, working and doing military service for several years, I came to the US for my PhD degree. Originally I would like to study economics, but then I switched my major to statistics. 

- I got my master degree in economics from Indiana University Bloomington, then I transferred to UC Santa Cruz to finish my PhD studies. 
- Then I spent two years doing my postdoctoral research at Rice University in Houston, Texas.
- Finally, in fall 2020, I came to Marquette as an assistant professor.
- Midwest/Indiana-West/California-South/Texas-Midwest/Wisconsin
- Been to any one of these universities/cities? 
- The most beautiful campus.
- Who are international students? I can totally understand how hard studying and living in another country. Feel free to share your stories or difficulties, and I am more than happy to help you if you have any questions.
- Poor listening and speaking skills. I was shy. 
- OK so, this is my background. How about you introducing yourself as well. You can share anything, your major, hobbies, your favorite food, what do you want to do after graduation, anything, 
- I have the class list. I'd like to learn your face and remember your name. You know, you all wear a mask. It's hard to recognize you and connect your name and your face. 
- When I call your name, you can say something about yourself. No need to be long, couple of seconds are good.

```

  


## Learning Management System ([D2L](https://d2l.mu.edu/d2l/home/589421))

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/01-syllabus/d2l_s25.png")
```

<!-- - Any new announcement will be posted in **News** in **Course Home**. -->
<!-- - **Content > Start Here: Course Information** includes syllabus and other useful information. -->
<!-- - Week modules (**Content > Week 1 to Week 15**) include course materials. -->


- **News**

- Submit your homework **Assessments > Dropbox**.

- Check your grade **Assessments > Grades**.

<!-- - Go to <https://www.marquette.edu/remote-learning/d2l.php> to learn more about D2L. -->


## Grading Policy &#x2728;
- The grade is earned out of **1000 total points** distributed as follows:
  - **Homework: 500 pts**
  - **Midterm mini-project presentations: 300 pts**
  - **Final project: 200 pts**
  
  <!-- - Midterm or Final Exam? -->
  <!-- - Attendance and class participation? -->

- `r emo::ji("x")` No extra credit projects/homework/exam to compensate for a poor grade. 

<!-- - Individual grade will **NOT** be curved. -->

<!-- - This is not a course that gives most of students grade A. Want to obtain a good grade? Study hard. No pain, no gain! &#x270D; &#x270D; -->


## Grade-Percentage Conversion

- Your final grade is based on your percentage of pts earned out of 1000 pts.
- $[x, y)$ means greater than or equal to $x$ and less than $y$.

```{r}
letter <- c("A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "F")
percentage <- c("[94, 100]", "[90, 94)", "[87, 90)", "[83, 87)", "[80, 83)",
                "[77, 80)", "[70, 77)", "[0, 70)")
grade_dist <- data.frame(Grade = letter, Percentage = percentage)
knitr::kable(grade_dist, longtable = TRUE, caption = "") |> kable_styling(position = "center", font_size = 40)
```

## Homework (500 pts)

<!-- - There are 4 homework sets. -->
- **Assessments > Dropbox** and upload your homework in **PDF** format.

- `r emo::ji("x")` **No make-up homework**.

- Due **Friday 11:59 PM ** (**Hard deadline and no late submission**).

- You have **at least one week** to finish your homework.

<!-- - Your homework grade is based on (1) the completeness and correctness of your PDF document and (2) your in-class presentation of homework questions. -->


## Mini-Project Presentation (300 pts)

- There will be 2 in-class mini-project presentations (150 pts each).

- Learn from each other by presenting and discussing the assigned topics.

- More details about the activity will be released later.



## Final Project (200 pts)


- The final project is submitted as a paper (and some relevant work?)

- The project submission deadline is [**Thursday, 5/8, 10 AM**]{.red}.

- More details about the project will be released later.

<!-- ## Academic Integrity -->

<!-- This course expects all students to follow University and College statements on [academic integrity](https://bulletin.marquette.edu/undergrad/academicregulations/). -->

<!-- - **Honor Pledge and Honor Code**: *I recognize the importance of personal integrity in all aspects of life and work. I commit myself to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, by which I earn the respect of others. I support the development of good character, and commit myself to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity as an important aspect of personal integrity. My commitment obliges me to conduct myself according to the Marquette University Honor Code*. -->

<!-- - `r emo::ji("x")` `r emo::ji("x")` `r emo::ji("x")` You know what I am talking about. Yes, **DO NOT CHEAT**. `r emo::ji("x")` `r emo::ji("x")` `r emo::ji("x")` -->


<!-- ## Attendance and COVID-19 -->
<!-- - It is **your** responsibility as a Marquette University student to protect the health and safety of our community in this course. -->
<!-- - Visit [What to do if you are exposed to COVID-19 or test positive](https://www.marquette.edu/coronavirus/what-to-do-if-you-are-exposed-or-test-positive.php) website for university guidelines on the best course of action.  -->
<!-- - Visit guidance on Spring 2024 [Class attendance, withdrawal, and grading](https://www.marquette.edu/central/registrar/faculty-staff/guidance-on-spring-2024-class-attendance-withdrawal-grading.php) -->
<!--   + Students are responsible for contacting instructors prior to the missed class session to indicate absence and the need to make up classwork/assignments.   -->
<!--   + Students requesting make up classwork/assignments are required to provide the COVID Cheq "stop sign" to confirm inability to attend class. -->
  

<!-- ## Comments and Questions from the Background Survey -->
<!-- `r emo::ji("question")` **... I hope to start with a refresher on basics of the math required in this subject.**   -->
<!-- `r emo::ji("point_right")` We will review probability, statistics, and matrix algebra before we need them. -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- `r emo::ji("question")` **... any way to receive assignments and projects with as much lead time as possible to allow for adequate planning would be most appreciated.**   -->
<!-- `r emo::ji("point_right")` You have at least one week to do your homework. I'll try to release assignments as early as possible. -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- `r emo::ji("question")` **I am hoping course material/lectures may be available online as well as in person.**   -->
<!-- `r emo::ji("point_right")` All course materials will be put on D2L. I am not planning to record lectures because of low watching rate and solving time-consuming technical issues during classes. -->


<!-- <br> -->

<!-- `r emo::ji("question")` **I like when topics such as these are related back to the real world.**   -->
<!-- `r emo::ji("point_right")` We will deal with some real data sets. But the data sets are much smaller and more organized than the real-world data. We focus on methodology, not data cleaning, tidying or wrangling. -->


<!-- ## Code {background-color="black"} -->
