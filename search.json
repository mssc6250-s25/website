You say “50–50”.\n\n\n\nI then flip the coin, take a peek, but cover it up, and ask: what’s your probability it’s heads now?\n\n\n\n\nThe event has happened, and no randomness left - just your ignorance!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Spiegelhalter (2024). Why probability probably doesn’t exist (but it is useful to act like it does). Nature, 636, p. 560 - 563.\nit handles both chance and ignorance.\nI will argue — whether in a scientific paper, as part of weather forecasts, predicting the outcome of a sports competition or quantifying a health risk — is not an objective property of the world, but a construction based on personal or collective judgements and (often doubtful) assumptions. Furthermore, in most circumstances, it is not even estimating some underlying ‘true’ quantity. Probability, indeed, can only rarely be said to ‘exist’ at all.\nTo get a handle on probability’s slipperiness, consider how the concept is used in modern weather forecasts. Meteorologists make predictions of temperature, wind speed and quantity of rain, and often also the probability of rain — say 70% for a given time and place. The first three can be compared with their ‘true’ values; you can go out and measure them. But there is no ‘true’ probability to compare the last with the forecaster’s assessment. There is no ‘probability-ometer’. It either rains or it doesn’t.\nThere is another lesson in here. Even if there is a statistical model for what should happen, this is always based on subjective assumptions\nMy argument is that any practical use of probability involves subjective judgements. This doesn’t mean that I can put any old numbers on my thoughts — I would be proved a poor probability assessor if I claimed with 99.9% certainty that I can fly off my roof, for example. The objective world comes into play when probabilities, and their underlying assumptions, are tested against reality (see ‘How ignorant am I?’); but that doesn’t mean the probabilities themselves are objective."

Thus, prior to ever stepping foot in the restaurant, you anticipate that it will be quite delicious. On your first visit, you collect some edible data: your pasta dish arrives a soggy mess. Weighing the stellar online rating against your own terrible meal (which might have just been a fluke), you update your knowledge: this is a 3-star not 5-star restaurant. Willing to give the restaurant another chance, you make a second trip. On this visit, you’re pleased with your Alfredo and increase the restaurant’s rating to 4 stars.

Since only 3 of the 12 people that tested positive have the disease (Table 1.1), there’s only a 25% chance that you have the disease. Thus, when we take into account the disease’s rarity and the relatively high false positive rate, it’s relatively unlikely that you actually have the disease. What a relief.\nsince disease status isn’t repeatable, the probability you have the disease is either 1 or 0 – you have it or you don’t. To the contrary, medical testing (and data collection in general) is repeatable. You can get tested for the disease over and over and over. Thus, a frequentist analysis would ask: If I don’t actually have the disease, what’s the chance that I would’ve tested positive? Since only 9 of the 96 people without the disease tested positive, there’s a roughly 10% (9/96) chance that you would’ve tested positive even if you didn’t have the disease."

Figure 4.9 shows why this criterion makes sense. Although the direction joining the centroids separates the means as much as possible (i.e., maximizes the between-class variance), there is considerable overlap between the projected classes due to the nature of the covariances. By taking the covariance into account as well, a direction with minimum overlap can be found.\nGaussian classification with common covariances leads to linear decision boundaries. Classification can be achieved by sphering the data with respect to W, and classifying to the closest centroid (modulo log πk) in the sphered space. Since only the relative distances to the centroids count, one can confine the data to the subspace spanned by the centroids in the sphered space. This subspace can be further decomposed into successively optimal subspaces in term of centroid separation. This decomposition is identical to the decomposition due to Fisher."

The situation is similar to OLS, however, in Lasso, it would only select one out of the two, instead of letting both parameter estimates to be large. This is not preferred in some practical situations such as genetic studies because expressions of genes from the same pathway may have large correlation, but biologist want to identify all of them instead of just one. The Ridge penalty may help in this case because it naturally considers the correlation structure. The following simulation may show the effect. - The Lasso problem is convex, although it may not be strictly convex in β when p is large - The solution is a global minimum, but may not be the unique global one - The Lasso solution is unique under conditions of the covariance matrix\n\n\n\n\nmssc6250-s25.github.io/website"

The 2D TV represents the 3D shows, programs or drama very well because the 2D representation does not lose much information the 3D shows provide.\nSo through the example, we know some dimensions are more important than others. Like here Variable X is more important than variable Y because variable X explains most of the variation stored in the data."

If everyone in this class gets grade A, then the data science grade is not an important variable to learn which students perform academically better than others."

So this is the price we pay for dimension reduction.\nBut let’s look at this example.\nThe first loading vector places approximately equal weight on Assualt, Murder and Rape, with much less weights on UrbanPop.\nSo PC1 roughly corresponds to a overall serious crime rate because PC1 explains the variations of data caused by those crime variables Assualt, Murder and Rape.\nOn the contrary, the second loading vector places most of its weight on UrbanPop, and much less weight on the other 3 features.\nSo we can say PC2 roughly corresponds to the level of urbanization.\nSo you get the idea, Assualt, Murder and Rape are similar each other because they all are measures of crime rate.\nSo when reducing dimensions, we sort of combine the three similar variables together to become a one single index that measures an overall crime rate.\nUrban population measures a totally different thing. So the variation created by this variable cannot be explained well by the crime rate, and it should be absorbed in PC2."

Now after collecting the data of the variables we are interested, we know their relationship, most of the time, is not perfect, and stochastic in some way and in some sense.\nAnd how do we model such stochastic relationship? Well the answer is a regression model.\nSuppose we are interested in the relationship between two variables, call X and Y. In particular, we like to know how changes of X affect value of Y, or we want to use X to predict Y.\nIn this sense, Y is called response, outcome, label, dependent variable, e.g., income\n\n\nX is called predictor, covariate, feature, regressor, explanatory or independent variable, e.g., years of education, which is known and fixed.\nExplain the relationship between X and Y and make predictions through a model Y = f(X) + \\epsilon. This is a very general regression model we can built to learn the relationship b/w x and y.\n\nf(\\cdot) is fixed but unknown and describes the true relationship between X and Y. \n\n\n\\epsilon is a irreducible random error which is assumed to be independent of X and has mean zero with some variance.\n\n\\epsilon is used to represent those measurement errors or the variation that cannot be explained or captured by the predictor X.\nIntro Stats:\n\n\nf(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X with unknown parameters \\beta_0 and \\beta_1.\n\n\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2).\n\n\n\nX and Y are assumed to be linearly related, which may not be correct.\nNext week, we will learn simple linear regression from the scratch and in much more detail. Here I just give you an overview.\n\n\nf(\\cdot) is assumed fixed from frequentist point of view; f(\\cdot) is random in the Bayesian framework."

In fact, this bias and variance will be then carried to the predicted values \\(x^\\text{T}\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\beta}^\\text{ridge}\\). Hence, we can judge if this is beneficial from the prediction accuracy. And we need some procedure to do this.\nRemark: The bias-variance trade-off will appear frequently in this course. And the way to evaluate the benefit of this is to see if it eventually reduces the prediction error (\\(\\text{Bias}^2 + \\text{Variance}\\) plus a term called irreducible error, which will be introduced in later chapter)."
