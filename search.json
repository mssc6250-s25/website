How about you introducing yourself as well. You can share anything, your major, hobbies, your favorite food, what do you want to do after graduation, anything,\nI have the class list. I’d like to learn your face and remember your name. You know, you all wear a mask. It’s hard to recognize you and connect your name and your face.\nWhen I call your name, you can say something about yourself. No need to be long, couple of seconds are good."

We use a function. Right.\nThe function y = f(x) gives us the relationship between an output Y and one or more inputs x.\n\nYou plug in the values of inputs and receive back the output value.\nFor example, the formula y = f(x) = 3x + 7 is a function with input x and output y. If x = 5, y = 3 \\times 5 + 7 = 22.\n\n\nBecause this is a linear function, we know that x and y are linearly related.\nWith a value of x, I can give you 100% correct value of y, which is right on this straight line. right. In other words, their relationship is 100% deterministic."

Right.\nThe second example comes from physics. the displacement of an object is a quadratic function of time.\nSo here s(t) = v0 * t + 0.5 * a * t^2. v0 is the initial velocity, and a is acceleration, and t is time.\nAgain the relationship between displacement and time is 100% deterministic.\nA value of time corresponds to an unique value of displacement given v0 and a."
