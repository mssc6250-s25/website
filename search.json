However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

We use a function. Right.\nThe function y = f(x) gives us the relationship between an output Y and one or more inputs x.\n\nYou plug in the values of inputs and receive back the output value.\nFor example, the formula y = f(x) = 3x + 7 is a function with input x and output y. If x = 5, y = 3 \\times 5 + 7 = 22.\n\n\nBecause this is a linear function, we know that x and y are linearly related.\nWith a value of x, I can give you 100% correct value of y, which is right on this straight line. right. In other words, their relationship is 100% deterministic."

Right.\nThe second example comes from physics. the displacement of an object is a quadratic function of time.\nSo here s(t) = v0 * t + 0.5 * a * t^2. v0 is the initial velocity, and a is acceleration, and t is time.\nAgain the relationship between displacement and time is 100% deterministic.\nA value of time corresponds to an unique value of displacement given v0 and a."

Now after collecting the data of the variables we are interested, we know their relationship, most of the time, is not perfect, and stochastic in some way and in some sense.\nAnd how do we model such stochastic relationship? Well the answer is a regression model.\nSuppose we are interested in the relationship between two variables, call X and Y. In particular, we like to know how changes of X affect value of Y, or we want to use X to predict Y.\nIn this sense, Y is called response, outcome, label, dependent variable, e.g., income\n\n\nX is called predictor, covariate, feature, regressor, explanatory or independent variable, e.g., years of education, which is known and fixed.\nExplain the relationship between X and Y and make predictions through a model Y = f(X) + \\epsilon.
