(Model selection)\n\n\n\n\nHence, by adding this to the OLS objective function, the solution is more stable, in the sense that each time we observe a new set of data, this contour looks pretty much the same. This may be interpreted in several different ways such as: 1) the objective function is more convex and less affected by the random samples; 2) the variance of the estimator is smaller because the eigenvalues of \\(\\mathbf{X}^\\text{T}\\mathbf{X}+ n \\lambda \\mathbf{I}\\) are large."
