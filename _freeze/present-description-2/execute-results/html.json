Please send me a [**one-page PDF**]{.blue} describing what you are going to do for your project (no word limit) with your **project title** by [**Tuesday, 4/8 11:59 PM**]{.red}.\n\n-   **Presentation**. You will be presenting your project on [**Tuesday, 4/15 in class**]{.red}.\n\n-   **Materials**. Please share your [**entire work**]{.blue} (slides, code, data, etc) by [**Friday, 4/18 11:59 PM**]{.red}.\n\n\n\n# Policy\n\n## **Proposal**\n\n-   *Each one of you loses 5 points of your project grade if you don't meet the requirement or miss the deadline.*\n\n-   Your proposal (in PDF) should include three parts:\n\n    -   **Project title**\n    -   **The goal of your project**. For example, what is the research question you'd like to answer? What machine learning method/model/algorithm you'd like to introduce? What data you'd like to use for analysis or demonstration? etc.\n\n-   Although it is risky, you can change your project topic after you submit your proposal if you decide to do something else.\n\n## **Presentation**\n\n-   Each group presentation should be between **10 and 11 minute** long, followed by **1 to 2 minute** Q&A. If your presentation is too short or too long, *every one of you loses 5 points* of your project grade.\n\n-   Every group member has to present some part of the group work. **The one who does not present receives no point**.\n\n-   [Questions are REQUIRED during Q&A. Each group is required to ask as least one question. More questions are welcome. If you, as a group, donâ€™t ask a question when you should, every one of you loses 5 points of your project grade.]{.green}\n\n::: {.green}\n| Team Presenting |  Team Asking Questions |\n|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Team 1          |  Team 6                |\n| Team 2          |  Team 1                |\n| Team 3          |  Team 2                |\n| Team 4          |  Team 3                |\n| Team 5          |  Team 4                |\n| Team 6          |  Team 5                |\n:::\n\n\n\n<!-- After the 1st group presentation, the 2nd group should ask at least one question in Q&A. After the 2nd group presentation, the 3rd group should at least ask one question in Q&A, and so on and so forth. The 1st group will ask the last group questions about their project. If you, as a group, donâ€™t ask a question when you should, every one of you loses 10 points of your project grade. -->\n\n\n## **Materials**\n\n-   *Each one of you loses 5 points of your project grade if you don't meet the requirement or miss the deadline.*\n\n-   You need to share your entire work, including slides, code, and data if applicable.\n\n-   Your code should be able to **reproduce all the numerical results, outputs, tables, and figures shown in the slides**, including the source of the raw data (where you find and load the data) if the project is about data analysis.\n\n\n\n# Project Content\n\nYour project can be in either of the following categories:\n\n1.  **(DA)** Data analytics using one or more **CLASSIFICATION** methods.\n\n2.  **(MA)** Introduce a new **CLASSIFICATION** model/method/algorithm not lectured in class.\n\n## Data Analytics\n\nFor your DA project, you need to\n\n-   Describe the selected data set.\n\n-   Explain and show why the chosen model(s) is appropriate for answering your research questions and better than others.\n\n-   Interpret your analysis result.\n\nBelow are some data repositories you can start with, but you are encouraged to explore more and find your favorite one.\n\n-   [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)\n-   [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)\n-   [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)\n-   [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)\n-   [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)\n-   [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)\n\n## Model/Algorithm\n\nFor your MA project, you need to\n\n-   Describe the intuition and idea of the method. What are the pros and cons of the method?\n\n-   Provide the mathematical expression of the model/algorithm. Explain the model and its properties, and how we do supervised learning with the model/algorithm.\n\n-   Compare the chosen method with other methods learned in class. Determine which method performs better under what conditions.\n\n-   Demo how to implement the method using a programming language for supervised learning.\n\n# Project Evaluation and Grading {#sec-grading}\n\n-   Your project performance grade is *determined by **your classmates and Dr. Yu***.\n\n-   Table 1 shows your possible performance grade. For example, if your group finish in second place (Silver) you get 145 points.\n\n-   Your project grade will be\n\n> project grade = performance grade - points lost due to violation of policy\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Performance Grade Sheet\n\n|              | Performace Grade ðŸŽ– |\n|:-------------|:------------------:|\n|Gold ðŸ¥‡ 1st   |        150         |\n|Silver ðŸ¥ˆ 2nd |        145         |\n|Bronze ðŸ¥‰ 3rd |        140         |\n|Other teams   |        135         |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Group Performance Evaluation\n\n-   You will need to **evaluate all group projects except the one you work on**.\n\n-   You evaluate group performance based on the rubric attached. Four evaluation criteria are considered:\n\n    -   **Project Content and Organization (8 pts)**\n    -   **Presentation Material (Slides) Quality (4 pts)**\n    -   **Oral Presentation Skill and Delivery (4 pts)**\n    -   **Interactions and Q&A (4 pts)**\n\n-   The total points of a project presentation is **20** points.\n\n-   Evaluation sheets will be provided on the presentation day.\n\nHow do you get the full points for each category? Check the rubric below. <!-- Note that for Content and Organization, data analysis and package projects have different requirements. -->\n\n-   **Content and Organization (DA)**\n\n    -   Beautiful visualization helps find out relationship of variables and specification of models\n    -   All questions are answered accurately by the models\n    -   Discuss how and why the models are chosen\n    -   Apply sophisticated models and detailed analysis\n    -   All ideas are presented in logical order\n\n-   **Content and Organization (MA)**\n\n    -   Explain the method clearly and accuratly\n    -   Show the pros and cons of the method, and compare with the methods learned in class.\n    -   Show how the method can be implemednted for supervised learning.\n    -   All ideas are presented in logical order\n\n-   **Presentation Material Quality**\n\n    -   Presentation material show code and output beautifully\n    -   Presentation material clearly aid the speaker in telling a coherent story\n    -   All tables and graphics are informative and related to the topic and make it easier to understand\n    -   Attractive design, layout, and neatness.\n\n-   **Oral Presentation Skill**\n\n    -   Good volume and energy\n    -   Proper pace and diction\n    -   Avoidance of distracting gestures\n\n-   **Interactions and Q&A**\n\n    -   Good eye contact with audience\n    -   Excellent listening skills\n    -   Answers audience questions with authority and accuracy\n\n-   After you evaluate all group project presentations, you rank them from 1st to last based on their earned points.\n\n-   **No two groups receive the same ranking**. If you give two or more groups some points, you still need to give them a different ranking, deciding which team deserves a higher ranking according to your preference.\n",
