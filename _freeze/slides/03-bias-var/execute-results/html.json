Right.\n- The function $y = f(x)$ gives us the relationship between an output $Y$ and one or more inputs $x$. \n    + You plug in the values of inputs and receive back the output value.\n    + For example, the formula $y = f(x) = 3x + 7$ is a function with input $x$ and output $y$. If $x = 5$, $y = 3 \\times 5 + 7 = 22$. \n- Because this is a linear function, we know that x and y are linearly related. \n- With a value of $x$, I can give you 100% correct value of $y$, which is right on this straight line. right.

Right.\n- The second example comes from physics. the displacement of an object is a quadratic function of time. \n- So here s(t) = v0 * t + 0.5 * a * t^2. v0 is the initial velocity, and a is acceleration, and t is time.\n- Again the relationship between displacement and time is 100% deterministic. \n- A value of time corresponds to an unique value of displacement given v0 and a. \n:::\n\n\n## Relationship between Variables is Not Perfect\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/03-bias-var/not-perfect-rel-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n::: question\nCan you provide some real examples that the variables are related each other, but not perfectly related?\n:::\n\n## Relationship between Variables is Not Perfect\n\n::: columns\n::: column\n💵 In general, one with more years of education earns more.\\\n💵 Any two with the same years of education may have different annual income.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./images/03-bias-var/graduation.jpeg){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: column\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/03-bias-var/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: notes\n- Here I give you a simple example: the relationship between income and years of education.\n- 💵 In general, one with more years of education earns more.\n- 💵 Any two with the same years of education may have different annual income.\n- Because your income level depends on so many other factors, not just years of education.\n- So when you plot the scatter plot of the two variables, you will find that there is some trend, but the data are sort of scattered or jittered or variated around some function that describes the relationship between income the years of education.\n- **<span style=\"color:red\">Red</span>** dots are observed values or the years of education and income pairs.\n:::\n\n\n## Variation around the Function/Model\n\n<!-- *Statistics is the explanation of variation in the context of what remains unexplained.*   -->\n\n::: question\nWhat are the unexplained variation coming from?\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\n-   **Other factors** accounting for parts of variability of income.\n    -   Adding more explanatory variables to a model can reduce the variation size around the model.\n-   Pure **measurement error**.\n-   Just that **randomness** plays a big role. 🤔\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/03-bias-var/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n::: question\nWhat other factors (variables) may affect a person's income?\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n`your income = f(years of education, major, GPA, college, parent's wealth, ...)`\n\n\n\n::: notes\n- And the data Variation around the Function, or in general the regression model\nis just as important as the model, if not more!  \n- Basically, what statistics does is explain variation in the context of what remains unexplained.\n- The scatter plot suggests that there might be **other factors** that account for large parts of variability. \n- If that is the case, adding more explanatory variables ( $X$s ) to a model can sometimes usefully reduce the size of the scatter around the model. \n- Perhaps just that randomness plays a big role.\n:::\n\n\n\n## Supervised Learning Mapping\n\n<!-- - $Y$: **response, outcome, label, dependent** variable, e.g., *`income`* -->\n\n<!-- - $X$: **predictor, covariate, feature, regressor, explanatory/ independent** variable, e.g., *`years of education`*, which is **known and fixed**. -->\n\n-   Explain the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ and make predictions through a model $$Y = f(X) + \\epsilon$$\n-   $\\epsilon$: **irreducible** random error [(Aleatoric Uncertainty)]{style=\"color:blue\"}\n    -   independent of $X$\n    -   **mean zero** with some variance.\n-   $f(\\cdot)$: **unknown** function^[$f(\\cdot)$ is assumed fixed from frequentist point of view; $f(\\cdot)$ is random in the Bayesian framework.] describing the relationship between $X$ and (the **mean of**) $Y$.

Now after collecting the data of the variables we are interested, we know their relationship, most of the time, is not perfect, and stochastic in some way and in some sense. \n- And how do we model such stochastic relationship? Well the answer is a regression model.\n- Suppose we are interested in the relationship between two variables, call $X$ and $Y$. In particular, we like to know how changes of $X$ affect value of $Y$, or we want to use $X$ to predict $Y$. \n- In this sense, $Y$ is called **response, outcome, label, dependent** variable, e.g., *`income`*\n- $X$ is called **predictor, covariate, feature, regressor, explanatory or independent** variable, e.g., *`years of education`*, which is **known and fixed**.\n- Explain the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ and make predictions through a model $Y = f(X) + \\epsilon$. This is a very general regression model we can built to learn the relationship b/w x and y.\n- $f(\\cdot)$ is **fixed** but **unknown** and describes the **true** relationship between $X$ and $Y$. \n<!-- - $f$ represents the systematic information that X provides about Y. -->\n- $\\epsilon$ is a **irreducible** random error which is assumed to be independent of $X$ and has mean zero with some variance.\n- $\\epsilon$ is used to represent those measurement errors or the variation that cannot be explained or captured by the predictor X. \n- Intro Stats: \n  + $f(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X$ with unknown parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$.\n  + $\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n- $X$ and $Y$ are assumed to be **linearly** related, which may not be correct.\n- Next week, we will learn simple linear regression from the scratch and in much more detail.
