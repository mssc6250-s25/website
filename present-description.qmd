# Timeline and Things to Do

-   **Team up!** You will be working as **a group of 3**. One of you, please email me your team [**member list**]{.blue} by [**Friday, 2/21 11:59 PM**]{.red}

-   **Proposal**. Please send me a [**one-page PDF**]{.blue} describing what you are going to do for your project (no word limit) with your **project title** by [**Friday, 2/28 11:59 PM**]{.red}.

-   **Presentation**. You will be presenting your project on [**Thursday, 3/6 in class**]{.red}.

-   **Materials**. Please share your [**entire work**]{.blue} (slides, code, data, etc) by [**Friday, 3/7 11:59 PM**]{.red}.


# Policy

## **Team up!**

-   *Each one of you loses 5 points of your project grade if you don't meet the requirement or miss the deadline.*

-   You will be *randomly* assigned to a group if you do not belong to any group before the deadline.


## **Proposal**

-   *Each one of you loses 5 points of your project grade if you don't meet the requirement or miss the deadline.*

-   Your proposal (in PDF) should include three parts:

    -   **Project title**
    -   **The goal of your project**. For example, what is the research question you'd like to answer? What machine learning method/model/algorithm you'd like to introduce? What data you'd like to use for analysis or demonstration? etc.

-   Although it is risky, you can change your project topic after you submit your proposal if you decide to do something else.


## **Presentation**

-   Each group presentation should be between **10 and 11 minute** long, followed by **1 to 2 minute** Q&A. If your presentation is too short or too long, *every one of you loses 5 points* of your project grade.

-   Every group member has to present some part of the group work. **The one who does not present receives no point**.

-   Questions are encouraged during Q&A. Everyone is welcome to ask any questions about the projects.


## **Materials**

-   *Each one of you loses 5 points of your project grade if you don't meet the requirement or miss the deadline.*

-   You need to share your entire work, including slides, code, and data if applicable.

-   Your code should be able to **reproduce all the numerical results, outputs, tables, and figures shown in the slides**, including the source of the raw data (where you find and load the data) if the project is about data analysis.


# Project Content

Your project can be in either of the following categories:

1. **(DA)** Data analytics using one or more **REGRESSION** methods.

2. **(MA)** Introduce a new **REGRESSION** model/method/algorithm not lectured in class.


## Data Analytics

For your DA project, you need to 

- Describe the selected data set.

- Explain and show why the chosen model(s) is appropriate for answering your research questions and better than others.

- Interpret your analysis result.

Below are some data repositories you can start with, but you are encouraged to explore more and find your favorite one.

  -   [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)
  -   [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
  -   [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
  -   [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
  -   [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
  -   [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)
  
  
## Model/Algorithm

For your MA project, you need to 

- Describe the intuition and idea of the method. What are the pros and cons of the method?

- Provide the mathematical expression of the model/algorithm. Explain the model and its properties, and how we do supervised learning with the model/algorithm.

- Compare the chosen method with other methods learned in class. Determine which method performs better under what conditions.

- Demo how to implement the method using a programming language for supervised learning.



# Project Evaluation and Grading {#sec-grading}

-   Your project performance grade is *determined by __your classmates and Dr. Yu__*.

-   Table 1 shows your possible performance grade. For example, if your group finish in second place (Silver) you get 145 points.

-   Your project grade will be 

> project grade = performance grade - points lost due to violation of policy

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# library(tidyverse)
first_ind <- c(150, 145, 140, 135)
# other_ind <- c(97, 94, 91, 87)
# grade <- tibble(first_ind, other_ind)
# grade <- as.data.frame(grade)
grade <- data.frame(first_ind)
rownames(grade) <- c("Gold ðŸ¥‡ 1st", "Silver ðŸ¥ˆ 2nd", "Bronze ðŸ¥‰ 3rd", "Other teams")
colnames(grade) <- c("Performace Grade ðŸŽ–")
knitr::kable(grade, align = "c", caption = "Performance Grade Sheet", label = "tbl:grade")
```

## Group Performance Evaluation

-   You will need to **evaluate all group projects except the one you work on**.

-   You evaluate group performance based on the rubric attached. Four evaluation criteria are considered:

    -   **Project Content and Organization (8 pts)**
    -   **Presentation Material (Slides) Quality (4 pts)**
    -   **Oral Presentation Skill and Delivery (4 pts)**
    -   **Interactions and Q&A (4 pts)**

-   The total points of a project presentation is **20** points.

-   Evaluation sheets will be provided on the presentation day.

How do you get the full points for each category? Check the rubric below. 
<!-- Note that for Content and Organization, data analysis and package projects have different requirements. -->

-   **Content and Organization (DA)**

    -   Beautiful visualization helps find out relationship of variables and specification of models
    -   All questions are answered accurately by the models
    -   Discuss how and why the models are chosen
    -   Apply sophisticated models and detailed analysis
    -   All ideas are presented in logical order

-   **Content and Organization (MA)**
    
    -   Explain the method clearly and accuratly
    -   Show the pros and cons of the method, and compare with the methods learned in class.
    -   Show how the method can be implemednted for supervised learning.
    -   All ideas are presented in logical order

-   **Presentation Material Quality**

    -   Presentation material show code and output beautifully
    -   Presentation material clearly aid the speaker in telling a coherent story
    -   All tables and graphics are informative and related to the topic and make it easier to understand
    -   Attractive design, layout, and neatness.

-   **Oral Presentation Skill**

    -   Good volume and energy
    -   Proper pace and diction
    -   Avoidance of distracting gestures

-   **Interactions and Q&A**

    -   Good eye contact with audience
    -   Excellent listening skills
    -   Answers audience questions with authority and accuracy

-   After you evaluate all group project presentations, you rank them from 1st to last based on their earned points.

-   **No two groups receive the same ranking**. If you give two or more groups some points, you still need to give them a different ranking, deciding which team deserves a higher ranking according to your preference.
